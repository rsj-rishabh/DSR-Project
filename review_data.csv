I suppose being sober in the cosmopolitan at that time next to the exit of one of the strips most popular clubs doesnt help.

Only thing was it cost quite a bit...30 bucks to be more specific. But it was worth it...it was vegas...and what ever..splurge. 

Next day went back and got a slice of classic peperoni. Still...super great and was really good.

The pizza is NY style and it was excellent! By Las Vegas standards, not too expensive.

For us, it was part of our Las Vegas bucket list. So this place is not so secret, it's a matter of fact pretty easy to find, tucked away in a corner, third floor at the Cosmopolitan. Both my husband and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok and that's not saying much since we were sort of hungry. After leaving there we went to In and Out to complete our late night dining experience.

Best way to describe the pizza, just think Sbarro's when you were 13 years old and your mom dropped you off at the mall. You and your friends having a Sbarro's pepperoni pizza was a fun experience and tasted pretty good. However, here are some differences, Secret Pizza is a bit more greasy, more expensive, your old friends aren't there, and less sitting space than at the mall.

They really do try their best to offer the ""cool"" factor, and what could be cooler than a pinball machine and old record covers on the wall as you walk in. For this place, once you have done it, the odds are you won't be back. But a fun thing to do anyhow if you happen to be at the Cosmopolitan. It will set you back about $10.00 for two slices of pepperoni pizza, and they have a water cooler, so no need to buy a soda. Also it is an interesting place to people watch.

Its is really not that tough to find if you ask around. They were out of the white pizza which I really wanted to try. Would not be ready for 20 minutes and I am not a patient person when it comes to food.

Wife and I ordered 2 slices each which came out to $5 a slice. We had the plain peperroni and chesse, and the mushroom with sausage pizza. Haaaaaaleluya....Haaaaaaaleluya! Yeah that is what I heard in the background as I took my first bites. Seriously excellent tasting. I even finished the crust which Is something I never do.

Pricey? Yes. Worth it. YES! A large pie will run you about $20.

The only reason I deducted a star is because there is no seating available, which would be cool if they did. I personally don't like to eat standing up.

Lol, I almost wish nobody knew about this place. This is definitely a secret worth keeping. It deserves every one of the 5 stars I have given it! I mean the pies are pretty damn good, but it just goes beyond that with everything else. 

From the moment you walk in & are greeted by my Paisan, Nico until you leave, you just can't help but feel giddy. When you step up to the counter, Nico just lays it all out, as only he can, starting you off with the pricing & some playful banter & all the different magic you can make with your slice or pie. The magic is definitely limited to your own imagination ;) 

However, I went with the basics, a slice of cheese & a slice of pepperoni & washed it down with a Barq's. My date du jour had a slice of cheese & some water. At which time, we took our place on some stools along the counter & did the good old pizza fold & chowed down! 

We strolled in about 2 am-ish, after catching a movie at Rave. I was totally craving a slice! It wasn't too busy at all, fortunately ;) It looked like there had just been a crowd in there, as it was a little messy. But that only adds to the charm of such a place. 

The most magical part of this late night pizza craving was, that it was all ""on them""! Unfortunately for us, or them, depending on how you look at it, they couldn't take cards at that particular time, which was all I had on me. So yeah, SCORE! Cuz, I do likes me some FREE eats ;) However, we did leave a nice tip for them in the tip jar. 

Overall, an awesome place to grab a slice or a whole pie. Definitely a cool vibe & not something you would expect to be in a stunning place, such as the Cosmo. You gotta really look for this place when you get up to the 3rd floor. Which is all I'm saying :P You will have to read the other reviews on here to find your way. Lol!",2,JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA

It's kind of the worst kept secret in town. 

Prices aren't exactly cheap, but it is in the Cosmopolitan and rent can't be cheap.

It's one of those places where they charge what they charge because they can. Like when you go to Disneyland and a bottle of water is $6 bucks. If you're desperate enough, you'll pay the $6 and be happy about it. 

Consider it a convenience tax.

They have nice pepperoni and they have a bianca with ricotta, which is kind of a dying breed these days.

It's good to have this spot in your back pocket if you're on the strip and dying for hot food and you've only got a hamilton in your pocket and lost all your credit cards.

Man, I wish I had saved my $25. 

The guy behind the counter prepping the pizzas was nice enough - explained how things worked without a condescending tone.  The girl helping out new to the operation, so there was a bit of a learning curve on keeping things going.  No problem; I've been in the same situation.    However, once the pizza went into the oven for re-heating and the money was in the register, that about ended an otherwise okay experience.

I swear it took like 20 minutes to get our 3 slices.  3 SLICES.  Another guy took over the pizza-making duties and made it his priority to only check up on the full pizza orders.  So when our slices finally came out, they were burnt at the crusts and essentially crackers at the base.  I told my fiance that I was not eating my ONE slice, he had to bring it back and ask for another slice (I told him to take his back too, but he was too nice to do so).  Another slice of margherita pizza that had been sitting there for quite some time that they could just throw into the oven for reheating.  I was really disappointed that they even gave us the pizza burnt - who serves burned pizza?!  That's already been cooked once?

We should've just gone down to Fashion Show Mall and had a few slices at Sbarro for a fraction of the price.  I guess if you want average pizza in a pretentious setting masquerading as hole-in-the-wall (literally) joint, this could be heaven.

If you think that, you obviously have either never been to NY, or were unfortunate enough to eat at one of the bad pizza spots. The positive reviews for this place must come from people who were completely obliterated when they ate here; that is the only way I can imagine anyone believing this to be good pizza. I came here with my husband after having a few drinks recently because Holstein's, our first choice, was closed. After waiting in line for 30 mins, we finally got our two slices. He ordered pepperoni and I had a regular slice; both were the most bland, dry, unappetizing pizza I have ever tried. There was next to no sauce on the pizza, and it tasted as if it had been under a heating lamp all day. Being that the place was extremely busy, the pizza coming out should not taste this way. Coming from NYC, I admit I have high expectations for pizza, but I've tasted better frozen pizza from Walmart. Not only did we have to stand in line for so long to get this disgusting food, but we had to eat our food standing against a wall because the place is so tiny.

The pizza itself? I thought it was great, I mean I blinked and it was gone.

Out of the three, the white was our favorite, and the meatball and ricotta was delicious too. However, the mushrooms on the cheese pizza with sausage was way too undercooked. It was a disappointment. Maybe it was because we asked to add them as a custom order.

I definitely recommend Secret Pizza to anyone, whether you're looking for a bite after walking the strip, or you've got the munchies after a few hours of partying. It's cheap, fast, and delish!",0,RZh_kTesRYc4ngF-_iIrAw

Pizza was nice and thin but not too thin. The crust was crunchy and not too thick. The salad was fresh and salami was good with spice. Get the salad to make it feel like you're not too fat.

Both red and white slices are made with premium, super-sized, toppings and the crust is great tasting, chewy, soggy at all, and shaped exactly the way NY pizza should be shaped.

There are no signs announcing either the presence or location of Secret Pizza.  Legend has it it started out as a room-service pizza source built for guests, but it was decided before it opened to allow walk-ins from outside the hotel as well.

My friend had read about this place on Yelp and knew where to look in general. However, if we had not known beforehand to be on the lookout we likely would have never found it. It is located down a dimly lit corridor with framed album covers hanging on the wall.  Secret Pizza may be hard to find, but once you do, you'll be a very happy camper!",11,q84kKzfAAKOYFfCLrmlajw

I would have never known about this place if it hadn't been for the nice concierge on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan while my mom and I were wandering around. He walked us over to this huge door and swung it open to reveal a hallway with a pinball game and loud rock music. 

The set-up is similar to a NY pizzeria in that there are no tables, just bars where you can stand and eat or grab an empty stool. I ordered a cheese slice for $3.50 which is unheard of in Vegas.

I came here with my boyfriend, and I had the impression that the pizzas would be more unique.  The pizzas are pre-made and each slice is popped in the oven for a few minutes as you order.  We asked the cashier what makes this pizza so great, and she replied, ""It's just good pizza.""

For $5, we shared one slice of the white pizza, which is topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I never had an orgasm in my mouth from pizza before, and needless to say, my boyfriend and I should have gotten our own slice.  After devouring that slice of pizza, we pulled out another $5 and ordered a slice of sausage pizza.  That was also very delicious, but I prefer the white pizza.

If you come with a large party, it's best to purchase an entire pizza to share since it's cheaper that way.

The Yelpers before me did an excellent job at describing where the place was located and that helped a great deal because it would have taken me a while.

I remember when the Cosmo first opened. My friends and I were...uh, inebriated, and we stumbled in here shoeless. 

I've had plenty of great memories with Secret Pizza since then. One time, we trekked from on side of the strip just for the pizza. I think that was at least a two mile walk.

Yeah, it was worth it and I'd do it again.

The cannoli's are my favorite. The pizzas, are duh- GREAT.

Maybe it's their secret way of keeping the place hidden and away from all the tourists.   Just find the public billiard table in the open floor, and then look for a long dark hallway which seems like it's a private entrance for staff.  Once you walk the long dark hallway, you will walk into a small pizza shop, and the smell of fresh pizza will immediately engulf you!

My friends split a cheese pizza, white pizza, and a pepperoni, olive, and mushroom pizza.  The line can get long, so be prepared to wait!  Once you order, the server will take your slice of pizza and bake it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and melty.  I believe a pizza slice comes out to be around $4 per slice.  I thought the price was slightly high since it was a super thin crust, and the slices didn't seem all that big.   The pizza was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the stuff served in NY.  I did not care for the white pizza, but the cheese and pepperoni pizza was pretty good.   Also, the crust was slightly chewy, which I did not like, but I really liked the cheese and spices they topped on the pizza.  One slice of pizza is like an appetizer, so I would suggest you order 2-3 slices a person, if you want to actually get filled up or eat it as a dinner.    I'd come back for a late night snack or an afternoon appetizer if I'm in the area, but it's not something I would walk from Wynn to Cosmo to eat.  Pretty good pizza, but not good enough to crave, especially with all the other eats in Vegas.",0,qnF-Fo5VDP5Tp2PxFsBNkQ

Secret is a solid pizza place and probably isn't much of a secret anymore but you will find that it's a hole in the wall with a long line leading through it. The pizza is pretty darn amazing after a long night. 

How it works is you wait in line and when you get to the front you can either create your own and order a whole pizza or you can choose from the slices they have out. Somewhat greasy but when it's 4AM, who gives a damn! Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the precut slices. The line also moves at a decent pace so don't be scared, it really isn't bad.

Ok, it's a decent slice from a place that's good to know about given the expense & absurdity of the strip. That's why 2 stars becomes a 3...but NOT a 4.

We tried the pepperoni, the onions and peppers, the white pizza and the sausage and meatball. The total with two diet cokes was 22.16.

We stood at the counter and enjoyed our slices. Nicely crisp (slight char) chewy crust, light sauce and gooey cheese. The least favorite slice was the sausage and meatball -- bland meats. The favorite was the onion and pepper slice.",4,ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg

I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close. 
My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it. 

Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night.
