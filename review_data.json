pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo \/ Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food. Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say...","788":"came here on Monday, no line. its good, but not to go out of your way good.  price is reasonable, it is hard to find. but that was the fun of it trying to find it.  no name, no sign.  if your clubbing @ the Cosmo and your have the munchies this is your place.  they use fresh toppings, crust is thin and very tasty.","3314":"This place is truly a secret!  Its so hidden that there are no signs in the directory of the restaurant itself except for the line of people waiting to enjoy a slice of the best pizza they ever had.  It is thin crust pizza, crispy crust and delicious toppings!  If you can go for lunch there is less of a line.\nTheir pepperoni was nice and oily just the way i like it","6726":"This SECRET  PIZZA was a secret for about 5 stays at the Cosmo. Now that I know where it is its my favorite late night snack. Ask for it well done and the crust will be perfect. The staff was great, they actually recognized me from the night before....I guess I've become a regular.","8969":"this is the BEST place to grab a quick slice of pizza. It's right on your way leaving Marquee, the employees are so friendly, and the pizza tastes just as good when you're as it does when you're drunk ;)","9552":"Never heard about this \"Secret Pizza\" place but my friends say they are the best and it was on a show. Well let me tell you this, it's the best pizza I've ever had. The white pizza is definitely the one to get. Just writing this review is making me hungry and craving for it even though I just had it like 4 hours ago.","11114":"Secret pizza is a hidden gem inside The Cosmopolitan.  If you're looking to get a quick slice of pizza before heading out on the strip this is the place to check out. Best slice of pepperoni I've had in Vegas!","14054":"this place is good, real good. the pizza in my opinion is a bit pricy for the slice you get. if the slice was a bit bigger it'd be worth it. the slice i got was a little bigger than your average chain pizza joints. if im in the area, will not hesitate to come back.","18831":"Mmmm. Reminds me of the pizza back in NYC, where I'm from. And I have high standards when it comes to pizza!\n\nThe first time we passed by, it was about 1am and the line was wrapped down the hallway and around the pool table. We went back the next day for a quick bite after some shopping and we were glad we did.  \n\nI'll definitely be back for more, as most of the pizza in Vegas is inedible.","19171":"This place is a hidden gem... literally hidden.  I'm not gonna go into too much detail, cuz I don't want too many tourists crowding the place and have it lose it's cool, speaky-easy-ness.  You'll just have to find it.  (Think of it as a fun game.)\n\nThe pizza is frickin' awesome.  The crust is thin and perfect.  \nAnd for the price, including a drink, it's an amazing value for a quick bite, or for some late night gnoshing after some drinking.\n\nDon't think that you'll be able to go and gather around a table.  It's not a pizza parlour.  Stools.  Counter tops.  Pizza.  Beer.  Awesome.","20921":"If you want to feel like a Vegas baller without spending a fortune, spend some time at the GORGEOUS Cosmopolitan hotel, check out the amazing shops and grab a slice of two of pizza at the Pizzeria. While it's certainly not the best pizza I've ever had, it's quick, cheap, and an entire group of friends from vegetarians to meat lovers can carbo load before a night of heavy drinking.","25835":"Wanted to like this more, but was not impressed. Tried pepperoni and a plain Sicilian. Line was long of course, and was hopeful due to the reviews. Very similar to Town Pizza in Highland Park LA.","26753":"I'm not much of a \"review or feedback\" person but this place is worth me signing up for a yelp account !!! It's the best pizza I have ever had hands down .... Like most newbees I had a hard time finding it here is a post that helped me find it : \n\n\"Take escalators to restaurant floor (third floor). At top of escalators you will be facing Jaleo. Immediately on the left of this restaurant is a (narrow by Vegas standards) hallway - the pizza place is down this hallway. You'll see people indulging in pizza by the pool table in this area and know you've hit the right spot. :)\n\nbest,\n\nthe pokerfoodie\"\n\nIf you stay on the strip and don't hit this place at least once your missing out big time!!!!","29391":"Definitely a MUST-TRY if you are nearby cosmo and are: 1) hungry AF and\/or 2) drunk AF. You will not regret ordering the white pizza. The whole pizza, if you can. I'm not kidding. It's THAT good (plus you save a little $ per slice, too and that's always a good thing!) And another awesome thing about this place is how it's awesome late! Perfect to come straight here right after Marquee lol (no yacking pls) but expect a long line due to other drunkies with the munchies *nom*","31192":"If I could only rate this place off the chart. BEST PIZZA on the strip!!!!! It's super fast paced so don't expect to sit. If your that kind of snob then don't bother reviewing. It's all about the pizza at this place. The pizza has this little crunch of perfection when you first bite it and it's orgasmic! It's so delicious!! I can't talk about it enough. I love coming here so, I never pass an opportunity to bring my out of town friends here... wish their was a local discount lol","31436":"Had the thin crust meatball and sausage pizza. Delicious flavor and the crust is perfect. Big slices of meatballs with massive flavor.  Highly recommended to ask for parmesan to sprinkle on top. Solid slice for Vegas!","32572":"Awesome\"after the club\" pizza place!! Cool staff, generous slices and you gotta try the white slice!! I was staying in the Cosmo and this place was recommended to me, so I have to pay it forward and tell you guys you gotta try it!! Enjoy!!","38624":"The pizza here is probably one of the best I've ever had .  They cook it  there in front of you - so you know it's fresh and boy does it taste good!\n\nI am marking them down because their selection of toppings was so very poor.  When asked whether they did chicken or beef toppings, they said they only did ham and salami and looked at me as if I were crazy!!  What kind of pizza place doesn't have a chicken or beef option???  Weird!\n\nNote that this is not really an eat in place, just a take out joint - well worth it though.","42029":"Great pizza, friendly and entertaining staff, and open late!","51381":"Personally the hype is not real... Perhaps it was extremely over-hyped up, maybe it was because I 100% sober haha. Idk it wasn't worth $28.50 for a pepperoni pizza. I live in Vegas and if you live here or visit I still think Verrazano Pizza and Rocco's Pizza are the best and waaay cheaper. \nWe got the traditional pepperoni pizza and maybe that was my mistake because I hate salami pepperoni. If I happen to ever go back, I will try one slice of the raved white pizza. \nThe price at Secret Pizza is RIDICULOUS... but what do you expect??? Vegas + Drunk people = Strip prices","58153":"Best pizza ever!  It was fun finding this place amd worth the time, offers pizza by the slice at a fair price. Guys running the place were super nice. If you need a late night snack this is the place to go while in Vegas.","59390":"This pizza was awesome!  It's not so \"secret\" anymore but it's worth seeking out for a slice. I had the white pizza after reading other reviews and it's was delish!  A little heavy on the garlic if that bothers you. It was perfect though for something greasy to help soak up the booze. \n\nYou don't sit down here- you grab a slice, eat at the counter and go. You also don't go here for beverages- there selection is limited. You go here for the pizza and that's it. It took about 4 minutes to get our slices. Well worth the trip down to the Cosmopolitan for this pizza!!","59589":"This is a hidden place without a sign which adds a mystery to it which it true to its name. Pizza is wonderful. It is not fancy but good midnight spot.","60355":"Horrible customer service stay away!!...I waited in line for an hour bcuz of the hype from my friends...got to the front only to be told that I wouldn't be served bcuz I cut in line...the same line I patiently waited in for an hour...when it was finally made clear by all around I had not cut in line did I receive an apology?...nothing close...instead the rude lady who had told me I cut in line then said \"look do you want to get served or not or get out of line!\"...with a few choice words I told her no and left...asked to speak to a manager outside...got the head chef who sided with all of her actions based on previous people who had cut in line...moral of the story...you are just 3 bucks for what looked like an average piece of pizza to this place...and they will treat you like trash with no apologies if they feel like it...stay away!!!","60872":"Like all the other reviews mentioned, the pizza place is down a long hallway--walls decorated in album covers.  Pretty neat.  Pizza is pretty good.. thin crust..melty cheese.  Cheaper snack while you are on the strip.","62295":"No matter where you are in Las Vegas, this is one of the best Pizza places there is! Whether your drunk or sober, the pizza is a treat! Be mindful of what time you show up here tho, FRIDAY and SATURDAY nights the line can be out the door and down the hall, but still worth the wait! Their white pizza is a must and their meatball on any pizza is a must! Love this place!","64800":"The secret pizza shop is worth the search. I would give directions but I don't like getting people lost.   3rd floor of the cosmopolitan shopping center, then ask another restaurant for directions. \n   Great old school NY pizza. Good prices, slices, great staff, nice variety. A great escape from the craziness of vegas, although I was there at 11 am on a Tuesday in December.","69528":"I love the secret pizza shop! this place is soo good. \n\nCame here on two separate occasions. First time was around 1am on a Saturday (er..Sunday morning) and the line was long. Took about 20 min to get to the front and my oh my...the drunkards have come full force. \n\nI suppose being sober in the cosmopolitan at that time next to the exit of one of the strips most popular clubs doesnt help. But we ordered a whole pie...their white pizza which consisted of olive oil, onions, mozzarella, ricotta, and gahhhhlic. Then we kicked it up with muchrooms and sliced meatball. OMG A. Maze. Ing. It was so good. the new york thin crust and the mounds of ricotta...just a taste explosion in your mouf. \n\nOnly thing was it cost quite a bit...30 bucks to be more specific. But it was worth it...it was vegas...and what ever..splurge. \n\nNext day went back and got a slice of classic peperoni. Still...super great and was really good. \n\nSoda and beer are served in red cups (same ones u buy at local costco or wherever) and its free refills (soda). i dont know what would happen if you brought your own from pre gaming in your hotel...\n\nWent to the restaurant next door and played some fooseball...that was a blast. the pool table had broken cues...but what do you expect.\n\nThe place is located on the 3rd floor between two restaurants...a japanese and a spanish. it has a large wooden door with no sign...","72123":"This is very good pizza and unique place. I order pepperoni pizza. Oh taste so good. I will comeback to try different kind of pizza. Highly recommend!","76129":"This place is great after a night of heavy drinking!\n\nThe white pizza is my personal favorite.  The offer a white deep dish pizza on occasion that is absolutely heavenly!\n\nThere is sometimes a line but there are pin ball and arcade games to keep you entertained while you wait.  The restaurant is small but very retro feeling.  I go here every time I'm in Cosmo.","80036":"The pizza was tender and delicious.   It just melts in your mouth.  I love round table's king arthur, but this pizza just melts in your mouth.  I devoured my slice in a flash.  My brother and I then bought a large and devoured that as well.  Pizza lovers have to come here.  It is on the expensive side for a slice of pizza, but overall is an amazing experience.","81873":"Great new york style pizza. Some of the toppings are not what you expect. The sausage and meatball are actually shaved which gives it a nice consistency. Before they serve your pizza, they give it a toast which makes the thin crust crispy. Real nice.","85633":"This place was so hidden that some of the Cosmo staff couldn't direct us in the right direction. \n\nI thought it was good, very greasy, and full of cheese. Only downfall is that they don't have ham. I luv ham, so a pizza without ham is like rice without meat, water without ice, and a shower without soap to me. Basically, it's a necessity to me. The huge pepperoni slices and sliced meatballs was filling, but it would have tasted better with ham. \n\nNot very many seats and it gets crowded because of the small space inside. We ordered a fresh made whole pizza and took it outside to sit on the large couches inside Cosmo. It was much more comfier outside and less noisy. \n\nI liked it, but I wish they had ham.","85640":"One of those places where myth is better than reality.\nNot a real hard place to find, not a hideway nor a secret place.\nLocated on 3rd floor and you'll see a large black door with a hallway  when you get off the escalator. Opens at 11:00 am. if you go before, you'll miss it for sure since they close the large door.\nIt's definitely a good pizza but definitely not the best. Probably best you can get around the area but you can get so much better even in LA.\n$5.00 a piece but ridiculous $3.25 for a drink. Go to 2nd floor store right below and get a soda.\nwe tried mushroom pizza and white pizza.","88776":"Great pizza. Make sure you go. Don't work too hard trying to find the secret location, just ask so you can get there fast. As simple as pizza is, many mess it up. Secret Pizza has it figured  out. My NY friend even loved it. Wait varies. Last time I went, I walked straight up and ordered. Nice staff.","89481":"Fellow yelpers this is a great place, I'm from New Jersey and we know good pizza..  :)  This place is awesome, no signs or advertising just hidden spot whose location is only spread by word of mouth.  Located down a long unmarked corridor.  No map in the hotel reveals its location.   Also opened later than anything else in a area to get good food when you are drinking and hungry\n\nWhen you walk in the first thing you'll notice is the long line of people..   (The secret is out) Mostly eat-in slices sold (about 5.50 a slice\/30 bucks a pie), less than a dozen seats and counter space and twice as many people than seats..  We ordered 2 pies (4 types) and we asked them to pick their most popular mixes...  So the first was the white pie..  Simple, thin crust Mozzarella and ricotta but the whole pie was soaked is an olive oil\/ butter garlic mix that was off the hook! My favorite..   The second was normal red Pie pepperoni and sausage.. The pepperoni was great but overly greasy and the sausage was weird looking but tasted good.  Next was a plain Cheese, sauce and mozzarella.  It was good but nothing to write home about except for the fact that this was good east coast pizza in Vegas! The last was a veggie mix of black olives, peppers and onions.. Overall really solid pizza..  \n\nShhhh- 3rd floor off the escalators.  Look for the long hallway..","90398":"Secret Pizza was the first stop of my friend's 22nd birthday celebration last month. She had heard so much about it that she absolutely had to include it. You know the drill. Whatever birthday girl says, goes.\n\nThis place really is hidden in The Cosmo though. Basically, you're looking for this random hallway. That's all I'll spill. Can't spoil it too much for everyone right?\n\nWe had seven people in our group, so we waited, and waited, then waited some more. It took a while to reach that point in line where you could see the menu and prices posted on a wall. I realize that they also fulfill phone orders from the hotel's guests, but we were practically forced to order individual slices because waiting for a whole pizza would take an hour. Anyway, we each finally got our $5 pizza slices after at least 30 minutes, then walked out to stand around and munch on 'em.\n\nTo be frank, the pizza was decent, but overhyped and not worth the wait or price.","90867":"Might be hard to find if you don't know about it, but I think it might be better that way.\n\nReasonably priced slices, and probably the best pizza on the strip. There was no line when I went but I could see there being a bit of a wait if you went later on in the night or ordered an entire pie.\n\nNext time I'll be sure to bring a quarter or two as well to enjoy the arcade machines while I'm eating instead of heading straight back out into the casino.","91272":"Awesome service and tasty pizza! Wanted to try their white pizza but will save it for next time","92094":"As soon as we heard about this place, we wanted to try it. We had 2 slices: a fluffy, square one (not sure exactly what they called it) and a pepperoni.\n\nThe square one was amazingly delicious with it's cheese and meat. It definitely hits the spot and satisfies the pizza craving, especially if you're a fan of a fluffy, Pizza Hut-type pizza. This is by far, the better. The pepperoni was great. I feel that a lot NY style pizzas are decent and this is far better than decent, but not as good as that darn square one. Big fan, will be back again before heading home.","93611":"Late night pizza at its finest. One of the few places open late after a long night on the strip.  ricotta and garlic hit the spot.","97652":"Best kept secret for some delicious pizza! Pepperoni is my favorite! Line can get pretty long and there isn't much space to sit and eat. We took our pizza to second floor and found a lounge area to eat.","98121":"Heard a lot about this place so decided to check it out. Thought it would be fun to search for but it really wasn't hidden at all. 5 dollars for a slice? Okay not bad.. 4 dollars for a soda?? More expensive than Disneyland but didn't mind, of course until I received my soda in a red Solo cup. 4 dollars for a red solo cup??? No thanks! All in all the pizza was okay","99858":"Great place!!! Will definitely come back!\nA slice for around $5-$6 but huge and delicious, can't complain. \n\nThe sausage and pepperoni is where it's at! The sausage is better than the average little pieces of sausage you'd find at other places. I've tried pin up pizza and this place I'd have to say, tops it in taste.\n\n\nThey offer parm, red pepper, and garlic at the table!","104899":"I was staying at the Cosmopolitan and heard about this place but, since I had meetings at most of my meals during my stay, it wasn't the sort of place that fit my schedule.\nBut, on the day I was leaving Las Vegas I wanted something quick and filling to hold me over until I got back to Phoenix and I hunted this place down.\n\nI guess when The Cosmopolitan first opened it was fun finding this \"hidden\" place. But, the word it out and other yelpers have even posted photos of the hallway to look for.  However, if you aren't paying attention and maybe you're a bit hung over it would be possible to walk right past it.\n\nThey mostly serve pizza by the slice with a number of selections available so you can go in, order, eat, and leave.  They'll also make you a pie but you'll have to wait for it.\n\nThe pizza is NY style and it was excellent! By Las Vegas standards, not too expensive.\nGreat spot for a good casual meal off the beaten path.","109854":"This was honestly the best pizza I've ever had.  If you want to keep things simple or if you're sick of eating buffets all day, stop by here and give their pizza a try.","112382":"It's in a \"relatively\" easy place to find. The wait times are usually super long. But it's the cheapest\/best food you can probably find in Vegas. There's also a nice pool table outside, so if you come with friends, you can hang out for sometime.","118598":"This place has good pizza, stick to less toppings and you'll be happier. At around 10pm this spot seems to be like a pilgrimage for drunk women so be prepared to wait.","119301":"This little gem has no sign an is down a small, non-descript hallway to the right of the sushi place in the Cosmopolitan, Blue Ribbon (3rd floor east tower).\n\nThey sell by the slice or for entire pies. Four of us split a pepperoni pie after watching Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" and drinking a fair amount. Best pizza I've had in awhile! Highly recommend you add it to your Vegas experience -- open late, when it's best.","120502":"Yes, yes and yes. Go up to the 3rd floor and walk forward from the escalators. You'll see an unmarked hallway and then you'll smell pizza... So good. Both their new York style crust and Sicilian are great. The white pie has garlic and cheeses. Ricotta to be specific!! So good. You won't regret this nice little break from the craziness of Vegas!","127262":"Love the texture of the crust and the constantly different kind of pizza popping out of there oven. W were the first one to get there.  Ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of sausage and peppercino. Then went back after that a split a slice of a different kind of sausage and ricotta pizza. Big groups I recommend maybe getting a whole pie and customizing it.","131113":"Because this place is somewhat of a secret it makes the pizza even more special.\n\nThis pizza is really impossible not to love, if you like pizza. This is that greasy NY style, big slice, perfect cust pizza that you crave. \n\nIf you're cool enough to find this place, welcome to the cool club but keep it a secret.","133165":"My friend told me about this great spot and I am SO glad she did!  It was the perfect cure in the afternoon for our hangover & we loved it so much so that we drunkenly returned that evening for a slice.  Worth the wait in line!  Total NY style pizza and super yummy!","137528":"First, we couldn't find the place. It is between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. When we went there, there was such a long line we just left. \n\nBut, we didn't realize there isn't any seating (well there are a couple of bar stools), and the line moves along at a pretty decent rate. We came back the next day and tried again and this time we waited in line. \n\nThe pizza tasted fine except for it being very greasy. The customer service was very good, but I wouldn't go there again because the food was nothing special. I'm sure the quality of ingredients is good, but it's pizza, and it is not hard to find great pizza.","139810":"Honestly, nothing special. First thing that popped in my head... the pizza from Costco tastes better. It's very over priced. My husband and I bought 3 slices total and one soda. That was $22. Honestly would not go back. \n\nIf you're looking to buy a whole pizza, expect to pay anywhere from $27-35. Sodas are $4 each (a red solo cup full).","140806":"Very good pizza. Loved the record cover hallway. Fun to be in on the secret. It's a busy place with not much seating but there's a lounge area nearby that most people use.","141444":"Really scrummy pizza. I played Ms Pacman for the first time in decades...I am still rubbish at it, but what fun! There isn't much else to say about this hidden gem. Would you go here for a candlelight dinner for two? Nope. Could it be the best slice in Vegas? Quite possibly.\n\n(Later edit: I have been back when I was the designated driver and had to up it to 5 stars! Not only is it the best slice in Vegas...it could be the best slice in the WORLD! Seriously!! It's THAT good)","141528":"Great low key pizza spot. The crust is crunchy and chewy. They were fast. It was tough to find, which made it fun.","148047":"If you want NY style pizza, find this place and order one.\n\nClassic NY style pizza, done quite well.  I prefer the straight cheese pizza, but their specialty is the \"white\" pizza, which is also very good.  takes about 20 minutes to get a pizza, or you can opt for a slice or two.  If it's after the clubs start closing down, who knows how long you'll be waiting.\n\n \nIt's on the 3rd floor in a small hallway to the left of Jalio (or however its spelled).  Small place, basically stand and eat.  They do have Hipster brew on tap though.  Reasonable prices and great flavor.\n\n \nAlso, the Cosmopolitan in general is probably the swankest place in Vegas right now.  I really dig it and it's a fun place to hang out.","148808":"Good, fast and cheap late night pizza at $5 a slice. 3rd floor in unmarked hallway. \nCrisp and tasty but pretty greasy so blot away","148958":"This Pizza is amazing! It's literally so good but I almost never get it because 1.) going to the cosmopolitan is a nightmare to drive to park ect. 2.) this artisan pizza takes a long time to make, and it's very busy so prepare to wait in line and then wait a long time for the pizza 3.) it's expensive when you're talking about pizza and 4.) while you sit there waiting 40 minutes for your pizza you will be in the company of the weirdest bunch of hipsters you will ever come across. All in all I will say the pizza is good, worth a try at least once.","153543":"We got the white pizza, delicious!!!!\nGarlicky and amazingly yummy!\nAnd the cannoli, delicious and not super expensive.\nWe are going back for more!","153583":"A really cool find on the Strip. A cool pizza joint hidden in the too fru fru for me Cosmopolitan.  Very good New York style pizza for not much $.  A must stop for all my future Las Vegas visits","155371":"My husband and I proclaimed to our friends that we were starving around midnight on a Wednesday while playing in Cosmo. So our friend tells us to go to the 3rd floor (it is the third floor, right?), walk passed the pool table, down a long hallway to get the BEST PIZZA.\n\nI must say I was intrigued and would have never found this place on my own.\n\nPizza was good. Crisp Crust, Cooked all the way through (Hey, I live in DE, where no one can commercially cook a good pizza besides a handful of places!), cheese bubbly and alittle burned (just the way I like it!).\n\nSurprisingly a great place to eat. Simple Food. Who would have thought you could find such a thing in Vegas!","156599":"Caught a morning flight and got in at lunchtime having eaten nothing all day. Staying at the Cosmo and remembered the pizza place. Super good. Awesome New York style so it's greasier than most regular pizzas, but just hits the spot. Only $5 for a slice too. Awesome place.","157188":"This place was perfect, quick, and friendly (but not putting up with b.s.) staff.   Make sure to ask if there's any fresh, out of the oven pizza, mmmmmm! White pizza had the perfect amount of garlic.  I can see how this gets ridiculously packed at like 2am.  Turn right after getting off the glass elevator on the third floor to get there.  Worth the detour!","157525":"OMG!!!!\nThis place is amazing! The girl who took my order was so awesome. There was some Irish dude and he was all \"I already ordered right! Why is this taking so long???\" And she was like \"You ordered 3 pizzas! It's not Pizza Hut!\" That pretty much shut him up! It was hilarious! My pizza was so good! It was hot too! The crust was super moist and flavorful. I would eat three pizzas if I could!","157532":"Besides being hidden and tucked away, this place is definitely a well known \"secret\".\n\nAfter a hard night of partying at Marquee, I stopped by, passed out on the chairs outside of this pizzeria. My guy stood  in line for about 45 minutes (at 3am, there was still a long line!), and bought me a simple cheese pizza and it was HEAVENLY!!!!!!!\n\nI came here 2 days ago and I am still thinking about how delicious my pizza was!\n\nDisclaimer - it might have been \"heavenly\" because I was drunk, but my sober friends tell me it was as delicious as I thought it to be.\n\nIf the cheese pizza was that delicious, I had to take a bite from my guy's sausage and mushroom (that's what she said). The sausage had a nice pepper kick. It was probably one of the best pizza's I've ever had in my life.\n\nTip -  You might as well order 2 slices if you're going to wait in this line. This pizza is so damn good!","157795":"Pretty amazing, i must say. Slices are huge, and tastes like it just came off a flight from NYC. Service is okay. A couple of the emp's aren't so nice. But overall, this pizza is definitely legitimate.","176959":"Secret Pizza was one of the places we were looking forward to on our last trip because many people talk about it, and the reviews are awesome. It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo with other restaurants (I think it's the level with a pool table on it), down the hallway with all the pictures.\n\nThere was no line and we were able to get our pizza right away. Each slice is preheated, and one of the disappointing things is that both of our slices were overly salty.  The slices were good, but no where near the hype. And not anywhere near the quality of an authentic slice from NY.  I think the slices were $5-7 each, and beer was $7-8.\n\nThe service was OK and there is virtually no seating. The atmosphere is nice (arcade games, bar top seating, etc). But the pizza was just OK. We found the slice at Flour and Barley (at the Linq) was much better.","178845":"Great pizza found late at night. After a week of too much pizza this was the one I enjoyed the most. Highly recommended, it is of the slightly greasy New York style pizza. Exceptionally tasty.","182081":"Hey white slice pizza...I want you badly!  \n\nThis simple secret pizza joint found somewhere on the 3rd floor at the Cosmo in Vegas is serving crack pizza and they are calling it \"The white slice\"\n\nI don't know what's on it, it's so simple and plain...just some kind of cheese and maybe some garlic? I dunno, but it is PHENOMENAL! I actually ordered a slice with a bunch of stuff on it cuz the \"white slice\" looked so plain, but I took a bite of my friend's and liked it better than the one I ordered! I went back and ordered it 2 more times. \n\nI think they close around 4am because when I first went to try it, it was closed :( I wanted to try it after seeing it featured on a TV show couple years ago and I always remembered it and boy am I sooo glad I did :) I dream about this pizza every night! I need this pizza in my life!!! \n\nTHE SECRET'S OUT!!! :D","185549":"It really is a secret.  No sign.  I was walking down the strip and was searching yelp for a good restaurant.  I saw that I was .1 miles from it Secret Pizza.  Took a while to find it but once there, I found a beer and really good pizza.   I walked back from Mandalay Bay the next day for lunch too.","188552":"Jersey approved! Found this place by chance and was content from the get! Walked into a huge line and everyone raving about how good the pizza is. We couldn't decide on one so we decided to order 1\/2 cheese 1\/2 white and it was amazing! Definitely worth the cost and everyone seems to have been here more than once during their stay! A++","192694":"Overrated!  Overpriced!  They reheat their pizza, the guy pulled out a slice of cold pizza from underneath the counter and reheated for us.  Needless to say, it tasted like a day old pizza reheated in the microwave, who knows when it was cooked.... Compared to a Lombardi's white pizza, well there is no comparison.  The Secret Pizza was luke warm (that reheating thing does not work for me), the cheese was really chewy (baked hours ago), and the crust was not really that thin like a true NY pizza.  Overall, this place is way overrated and overpriced.  $6 for a slice of pizza is no deal......\n\nThis place should stay \"secret,\" BTW, unlike many of the other reviews, I was sober when I ate the pizza....","193266":"We were in town and decided to have a little food adventure to find this place. We were a little disappointed because it wasn't as \"hidden\" as we thought it would be but that just may be because we hyped it up to ourselves so much. \n\nAs far as the pizza, it was fine. A little too greasy for my taste but the pepperoni was tasty. So was it the best pizza I've ever eaten? Definitely not. Would it be very satisfying at 2am after some drinks? Absolutely.","196832":"yay best place to get some awesome tasty pizza and cheap ! while gambling in the cosmopolitan  ! love this place!","199866":"Holy little baby Jesus! This place is awesome! Ridiculously good. Awesome decor. Now... the only problem is finding it. But I think that may be a good thing lest it be overrun by drunk hillbilly's with giant blenders of frozen goop.","200466":"Delicious... New York style... Greasy cheesy and crispy!!! Mmmm if you're not a pizza lover don't come !!!","204296":"Overpriced, mediocre tasting pizza, staff is not friendly, and the menu does not reflect the other pizza slices they offer, which is inconveniently hidden out of sight. This place is right in front of Blue Ribbon restaurant and easily missed.","205492":"It would be 5 stars but I've had times where I waited 30 minutes and still couldn't get a pizza as the line was just waaaayy too long. Great place though.","210077":"Went here after reading other reviews.  Reasonable price and 1 slice was plenty for me.  A little greasy but the crust was thin and the cheese and toppings plentiful.    Would go again just because price is reasonable.","211475":"I haven't heard of this place until a few months ago. Of all the times I've been to Vegas, I can't believe I missed out on this \"secret pizza\". The place is really hidden but once you see the records on the wall then you are at the right spot. The place is small so space is limited. The pizza here is awesome !! The first bite of it will make you understand why this place is a secret. I ordered a slice of the sausage pizza and it was off the hook !!! I'm definitely coming back for my pizza cravings.","213853":"Really....?????\nThe pizza has no taste....\nThe worse pizza I ever have. Any other pizza is better than this junk. I brought my brother in law visiting from overseas, they just watched Le Reve at Wynn, so we went here, because he likes pizza. This shit has 2000 yelp reviews.... it's so embarrashing. The couple who sat next to us wanting to talk to me. They found this place from Yelp.","215705":"We Found Sbarro's Cool Cousin at the Cosmopolitan!\n\nFor us, it was part of our Las Vegas bucket list. So this place is not so secret, it's a matter of fact pretty easy to find, tucked away in a corner, third floor at the Cosmopolitan. Both my husband and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok and that's not saying much since we were sort of hungry. After leaving there we went to In and Out to complete our late night dining experience.\n\nBest way to describe the pizza, just think Sbarro's when you were 13 years old and your mom dropped you off at the mall. You and your friends having a Sbarro's pepperoni pizza was a fun experience and tasted pretty good. However, here are some differences, Secret Pizza is a bit more greasy, more expensive, your old friends aren't there, and less sitting space than at the mall.\n\nThey really do try their best to offer the \"cool\" factor, and what could be cooler than a pinball machine and old record covers on the wall as you walk in. For this place, once you have done it, the odds are you won't be back. But a fun thing to do anyhow if you happen to be at the Cosmopolitan. It will set you back about $10.00 for two slices of pepperoni pizza, and they have a water cooler, so no need to buy a soda. Also it is an interesting place to people watch. Both the clientele and staff offer free entertainment. Enjoy!","216477":"This place has ruined me for any other pizza. It was amazing!  Will stop everytime I'm in Vegas.","220624":"Great simple pizza.  Love the meatlovers.  The price is right and the atmosphere is simple and inviting. Check it out.....if you can find it","222449":"Has a New York style and great cheesy taste. Pepperoni was spicey. Mom liked the mushroom pizza.  On the pricey side.","225673":"Definitely not a secret... once we figured out where the 3rd floor was ... the long line and scent of pizza made it easy to locate. Pretty quick service, only thing that bothered me was when I went to fold it in half to stuff in my face the tip kept falling into itself. No biggie though. Fresh tasting. .. sausage had good flavor so did the crust and sauce.","226747":"Got to deduct at least one star. While you have great pizza with a perfect crust; I requested some salt and pepper and was told \"sorry we don't have any\"","230559":"The crust was amazing.\n\nI hesitate to call it NYC pizza, because the majority of NYC pizza I've had is crap compared to this.","231005":"get the white pizza - mozzarella cheese, feta, and garlic (no red sauce).  totally yum. all their pies have a thin, new york crust and you can easily (easily) eat three. i'd pretty much eat any of the pizza there.  It's a a great little spot that i love to stop by if i've had a couple of drinks, and even when i haven't.  get a whole pie because you might as well.  a whole pie is a little over $20, while a slice is about $3","231628":"Will, Hector make a great pizza. Nice casual environment to enjoy a $5 pizza.  Buried on third floor of the Cosmo hotel surrounded by $$$ restaurant.  A definite \"gotta go\" for a excellent slice of real NY pizza","235274":"The best pizza in town and great beer. Defiantly a must have when in Las Vegas.","236673":"Great pizza, and super cheap. Just like New York. It's on the 3rd floor just straight and to the left once you get off the escalator and down the vinyl cover decorated hallway like other reviewers stated. We talked to the guys there about the myths that they import their water from Brooklyn and their Italian flour from Italy. They said, \"no, it's just really good pizza with regular water and ingredients.\"\n\nProbably the best New York style pizza on the strip.","237120":"I was surprised that so many good reviews for this pizza. So I went to find it, it's really hard to find it by yourself since it isn't on the list near the escalator. Better to ask the persons working there. \n\nThe place is small and simple, very different from the environment. I cared about the environment of the restaurant a lot! This place is not a good place, I have to say.\n\nBut the taste is good, I think. If u want to have a meal fast, it would be ur option.","238138":"Although the pizza might be good, the lines at 2am are nuts and last forever. It's only pizza, hard to think you'll spend over an hour in this line.\n\n\nGood food, just need to serve customers faster.","241812":"The wait was about 30 minutes for this place on a Saturday night, considering that awesome late night urge to consume pizza after copious amounts of drinking and debauchery.\n\nMy friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders\/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.\n\nPS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck.","243621":"Pizza was yummy... \n\nI had the White Pizza which I really enjoyed!!  It had a garlicky taste and no red sauce!\nMy daughter had a silce of Cheese Pizza.  She said it was crispy and cheesy.\n\nTheir drinks are expensive but served in a Red Solo Cup!!","244151":"Like many humans, I love pizza. But this place. I'm ready to have a love affair with this pizza. The rigatoni, mozzarella, and garlic pizza was so delicious and foldable, and grease was literally dripping down my arm. \nWhat a fun place! It really is a hole in the wall. You go to the third floor and then just go straight down the sketchy hallway."},"useful":{"0":0,"788":0,"3314":0,"6726":0,"8969":0,"9552":0,"11114":0,"14054":1,"18831":1,"19171":1,"20921":0,"25835":0,"26753":0,"29391":0,"31192":0,"31436":0,"32572":0,"38624":0,"42029":0,"51381":1,"58153":0,"59390":0,"59589":0,"60355":0,"60872":1,"62295":1,"64800":0,"69528":3,"72123":0,"76129":0,"80036":1,"81873":1,"85633":0,"85640":1,"88776":0,"89481":3,"90398":3,"90867":0,"91272":0,"92094":0,"93611":0,"97652":0,"98121":0,"99858":0,"104899":12,"109854":0,"112382":0,"118598":0,"119301":1,"120502":0,"127262":0,"131113":0,"133165":0,"137528":0,"139810":0,"140806":0,"141444":1,"141528":0,"148047":0,"148808":0,"148958":0,"153543":0,"153583":0,"155371":0,"156599":0,"157188":0,"157525":0,"157532":0,"157795":1,"176959":1,"178845":0,"182081":0,"185549":1,"188552":4,"192694":1,"193266":0,"196832":1,"199866":0,"200466":0,"204296":1,"205492":2,"210077":0,"211475":2,"213853":0,"215705":0,"216477":0,"220624":0,"222449":0,"225673":0,"226747":1,"230559":1,"231005":0,"231628":0,"235274":0,"236673":3,"237120":1,"238138":0,"241812":1,"243621":0,"244151":0},"user_id":{"0":"msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g","788":"D1_nrBr4dOrs7M82OaBRwQ","3314":"jEjc8HxeCeI22M4di0Y1aw","6726":"RTiaaHSN80VRTLSdNK5rfQ","8969":"hBmJs49zYcXdV4wo8F5iiA","9552":"waUrPSBpHvrnrEtSVCEiYQ","11114":"1Yq4Xv1W_pA7VfD6GusuxA","14054":"neGH9zU2RG1F3fD-c4_ykg","18831":"7XTQK7OX-d_Fiv05uhNydw","19171":"Maj7Gl89JLK9Sp21ckrvew","20921":"9kb3j5CuU1zTOHcZ9WlKNg","25835":"XOaI9R06TfnIrrgB1GtKIQ","26753":"JNDWdmEJoEEGeiE5urNGHg","29391":"qrTVWMqSafe5X8FJYE1eqg","31192":"5_SsPRKbjJgQm_bhG6bYVQ","31436":"uxmn0gwobcwretUT1i3JVw","32572":"NVSJWPpT2V54xJVVrcAUsA","38624":"ZBgo4gWOBPAdv_StoI6voQ","42029":"zDg5hYLM16mffxdMJUUNhQ","51381":"wVvyI4GW0mKVhltAYOonoQ","58153":"87xM_Rw4CxMkLimsZPE1zg","59390":"k7Zjd36zIIZZPX-KdivZlw","59589":"q0Fib7dO9eN05fcSrMU47g","60355":"Z9zizcx1ofXNYaH4OWmBVg","60872":"H2SN20jdOSOpf17QQOSzVg","62295":"xaBLkvnxhRJl39ykKw8vfw","64800":"Gfj-lYEAqE-qgxq4Fz0cuw","69528":"shmIbSORu6G5sVQ6-RrmuQ","72123":"i00q34QJWY7FSJFjc7m1wg","76129":"XG1tZ9csSuDdgFxqbKqcgQ","80036":"mXEvgQU3ml42RDnuaUs_tw","81873":"HEzVlIJeVpwjiNCPXNM-aA","85633":"_RZUfGvv13R4PACFngFxDA","85640":"dBdgHFnTzkIdl0dd4p9Law","88776":"ZyX2x0YTSe_-qBSvTDewzQ","89481":"0k6tH1bD4tFdXNEd7t0msg","90398":"EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg","90867":"SDUpHdVhbaJgrbyzRRUPDA","91272":"D097-i-9hE-MLTLDBtD20A","92094":"eUqRSK6oO5OYJ7YVvRlx1w","93611":"OHzgSO3k1zpuO61Ji9NIdQ","97652":"aajK988a16mxdxYScG8vxw","98121":"Ht7pu0Fh8WwquNLPQIWUkw","99858":"6vcbyjQ5C6tasI4P69CvHg","104899":"8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw","109854":"Wb2u0Nju_vCvWP3kXojbtQ","112382":"xWiLmkuiVwDnrutAJE3SIA","118598":"u8RCf1vViSL-capWAwDqjA","119301":"Hn_R1tGgHP-16TO6ZOKKPw","120502":"SBDsacynEE_YioxCdHJuTw","127262":"WO04X8RQ5DIvJNK7CZbfiQ","131113":"xR-QCGdqlcUqrGIxExs_lA","133165":"qn1WbhMb-ztglkbh7Lx3PQ","137528":"u0NCMq7f2NRumeiKxOtarw","139810":"a5Q0gCBgpWpdQ5gvtp3UzQ","140806":"IYQAnRZ892JSoAkZPEiRCQ","141444":"BJOLgnc5gtHlkwhBIqNW5Q","141528":"goO1wU3cCAG6IdgRgmNFBw","148047":"GFPx32mip-47kDOGYeJzog","148808":"ffdCKek8XLmzfNdzovDi_w","148958":"1eSttb7yz3o-Jcl8uc3tWg","153543":"tTLX-LPIjxGcNPcM-sYcgg","153583":"OZtxDzxlnr4GHdzTznTsyw","155371":"XjLvFaNKzzprEDRR-3kxsQ","156599":"XofgJiqtyVZTBB2R9sg5Ng","157188":"_AHPkpG45ccz8Vo6EzG7Ng","157525":"88-OyLARzpxx_Kka8XDx1Q","157532":"I9HfcU8KrcFp5MxnXN6qPg","157795":"sEsAi7Z9tmjyTWwLG6OaDw","176959":"QPJ229sh0rGOUSMpRgKn1Q","178845":"IvD13kKHb00aTQ-nFKeNpg","182081":"h5XwN4jUVicoqy6maTF9UQ","185549":"9JjznD1_6CA11h2d635SNg","188552":"YH0HhvBIbm5ZcyOyFahxwg","192694":"Cm-hPBkESyhT4T-WvlrNvA","193266":"hFNK10uVf8kN3P-AvMqm1Q","196832":"xrao7YwUnJhqLyUsB-oQyA","199866":"mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ","200466":"6oYsGvJx2Dm23fdqTfaSCg","204296":"9btRviiGt5BPsYNhoOOU2w","205492":"wglXRvdSv2UsPS6sxAZ4sA","210077":"1NA9gt46Oii4MTmYJufNwg","211475":"x0CdGrjdr3tbohbx_Id00A","213853":"_mDCCBQJ-IlqZ5lT_sYy9w","215705":"hFZ9IM1VjG7vSV7UPOidEg","216477":"L1xE0rhAml6nxrlbHAhfbQ","220624":"D2F62s444IMH2hVcbCdmDQ","222449":"e3ptOFuKKffiBF9T1DCpnA","225673":"odfOrOTH-_VFc00NwyOmEA","226747":"Wwa7RshRpvf5Ob2zeS6fng","230559":"lwQwygtGIWQ9RxgTAUphaA","231005":"pLUBav1Yf0S3ivYlyQvrdg","231628":"NNPl3sB-B7ARmkHXFNaPSw","235274":"CJDFWY5R6rh6pB7hL_B2xw","236673":"QojMaPonwhVMef_E0x3YGA","237120":"627UjdPOyOcx3VAsRwfxhA","238138":"3raKk2mtXoiSNwUZ_dku8Q","241812":"V2BIRBZQZHqSc3SmDcUxfA","243621":"zaE6VkvJwU1_TTwEyUlBDQ","244151":"-hb-jWOSILqYDe8HLrr9aQ"}}
